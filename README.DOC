    ISVGA256.BGI  --   A Super VGA BGI driver for Turbo C and Pascal
                       that integrates support for multiple SVGA chipsets
                       into one driver.

                  --   Due to a limitation in both TC and TP you can't
                       use setgraphmode() to set a mode higher than 0ah
                       without patching the compilers.  A patch is supplied
                       in this archive that, using Borland's PATCH.COM,
                       will increase this limit to 40 modes.
                       To install the patch just run the PATGRPTP.BAT file.
                       Make sure Patch.com is in your search path.
